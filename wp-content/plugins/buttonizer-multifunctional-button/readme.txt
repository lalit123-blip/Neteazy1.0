== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Floating Action Button and why should I use it? =

A floating action button is a button that 'floats' on the right corner of your website.

Maybe you noticed already that a lot of applications (mobile and web) have their primary floating action button (FAB), on the right corner of their website or app. You see this a lot with chat funtions. The Floating Action Button is becoming a standard in application and webdesign. Webvisitors are getting more and more used to the fact that there is a floating action button which is the primary action you can make on that page, on the right corner of a website.

The Buttonizer is a new way to give a boost to your number of interactions, actions and conversions from your website visitor by adding a Customizable Smart Multifunctional Floating Button in the corner of your website.

= What's the difference between floating action buttons or other conversion buttons? =

With Buttonizer you don't just add the same button to every page on your website. No, the key is that each action must be relevant. With the Buttonizer it&#39;s possible to add buttons to a select number of pages with "page rules", decide for each button if it shows on mobile and/or desktop, style your button with your own icons & colors, add social sharing buttons, Show the button on opening hours and make use of many more rules.

And the beauty of all: All actions are hidden in one button. The moment a visitor clicks on your Floating Action Button it will *pop* all specific buttons you&#39;ve set for that page. Track each single button in Google Analytics so you can see which actions your visitors prefer.

In fact, Buttonizer is an addiction to use. Your website visitors will interact as never before.

= Which buttons are available with Buttonizer? =
WhatsApp chat, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Email, SMS, Snapchat, Twitter, LinkedIn, Skype, Vkontakte, Phone (click to call), Telegram, Line, WeChat, Viber, Waze, Google maps, Poptin, Custom URL, Page Select.

= I don’t see the button on my site, what should I do? =
Please make sure you’ve chosen at least one button and clicked on the green “Publish” button. If you still don't see any changes on the live site, you can clear the cache of your website if you have a caching plugin.

= Can I add multiple floating action buttons with the free version? =
Yes you can but you can only choose one location (one button group with unlimited number of buttons). If you need multiple buttons on different locations you will need the premium version of the plugin. 

= Does Buttonizer work on mobile? =
Yes, you can choose for each button if you want to display the button on mobile, desktop or both.
